//TODO: How Variables Should Be Named

/*Good variable names are descriptive, provide context, and follow JavaScript naming conventions (camelCase for variables and functions*/


//Examples

let userAge = 25;                  // Good: Clear and descriptive
const MAX_LOGIN_ATTEMPTS = 3;      // Good: Constants in uppercase with underscores
let calculateTotalPrice = (price, tax) => price + tax; // Good: Descriptive function name


/*Bad variable names are vague, lack context, or do not follow naming conventions. Here's an example:*/



//Examples

let x = 25;               // Bad: Unclear what x represents
const number = 3;         // Bad: Generic name, should indicate its role as a constant
let fn = (a, b) => a + b; // Bad: Non-descriptive function and parameter names
